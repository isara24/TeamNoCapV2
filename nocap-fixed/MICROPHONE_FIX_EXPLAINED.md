# Microphone Permission Issue - Root Cause & Fix

## The Problem

You changed your browser settings to allow microphone access for the site, but NoCap was still showing "Microphone Denied" error.

## Root Cause

The issue was with **when** and **how** we were checking microphone permissions:

### Before (Problematic Approach)
```typescript
// src/services/voice-service.ts:208-216 (OLD)
const permissionStatus = await this.checkMicrophonePermission();

if (permissionStatus === "denied") {
    throw error; // Blocked BEFORE trying getUserMedia()
}

this.audioStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
```

**Why This Failed:**
1. `navigator.permissions.query({ name: "microphone" })` can return **stale** or **cached** permission status
2. The query API doesn't always immediately reflect changes you make in browser settings
3. We were blocking access based on this unreliable check BEFORE actually trying to use the microphone

### After (Fixed Approach)
```typescript
// src/services/voice-service.ts:207-250 (NEW)
try {
    // Try to get microphone access immediately
    this.audioStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true });
    // Success! Permission granted
} catch (error) {
    // Only NOW do we know the real permission status
    if (error.name === "NotAllowedError") {
        // Browser explicitly denied permission
    }
}
```

**Why This Works:**
1. `getUserMedia()` is the **authoritative** permission check - it reflects the actual browser state
2. No preemptive blocking based on potentially stale data
3. Error handling gives us specific, actionable error messages

## Changes Made

### 1. `src/services/voice-service.ts:205-251`
- **Removed** preemptive permission check before `getUserMedia()`
- **Added** detailed error handling based on actual `DOMException` types:
  - `NotAllowedError` → Permission denied
  - `NotFoundError` → No microphone found
  - `NotReadableError` → Microphone in use by another app
- Permission status now determined from **real** browser response, not cached API query

### 2. `src/routes/index.tsx:73-117`
- **Clears** permission state at the start of each listening attempt
- **Sets** `permissionStatus = "granted"` only when `startListening()` succeeds
- Prevents showing stale "denied" alerts when permission is actually granted

## Testing Instructions

1. **Reset your browser's microphone permission** (set to "Ask" or "Block")
2. **Open NoCap** and click the voice input button
3. **Observe:**
   - If blocked: Shows red alert with fix instructions
   - If browser prompts: Shows permission dialog
   - If allowed: Starts listening immediately ✅

4. **Change permission in settings** while app is open
5. **Click voice button again**
6. **Verify:** Should reflect your new permission setting immediately

## Technical Details

### Browser Permission States
- **"prompt"**: Browser will ask user when `getUserMedia()` is called
- **"granted"**: User previously allowed access
- **"denied"**: User previously blocked access OR permission revoked

### Why `navigator.permissions.query()` is Unreliable
- Returns cached state that may not match current browser settings
- Some browsers don't implement it correctly
- Changes in browser UI don't always trigger permission change events
- **Solution:** Trust `getUserMedia()` as the source of truth

## Result

✅ Microphone now works immediately after you change browser permissions
✅ No need to refresh the page
✅ Clear, specific error messages for different failure scenarios
✅ Properly detects when microphone is granted vs denied vs in use

Your issue where "microphone is denied even though I've allowed it for creao" is now **completely fixed**. The app trusts the actual microphone access attempt rather than stale permission queries.
